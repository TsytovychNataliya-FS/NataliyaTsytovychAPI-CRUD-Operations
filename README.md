# API CRUD Operations

>Worked on using API CRUD to crate a simple aplication that will receive data, post, put, and delete with ID upon request. 


## Features

> GET: Retrieve all items or a specific item by ID.
> POST: Create a new item.
> PUT/PATCH: Update an existing item by ID.
> DELETE: Remove an item by ID.
